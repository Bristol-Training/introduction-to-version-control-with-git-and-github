title: "Installing Git"
---


Git is open source, free, and is available for easy installation on a range of operating systems,
including Windows, macOS and Linux.

You will need to have installed the command line version control tool "git". 
The instructions below tell you how to install it on each of these platforms.

### Windows

You can install git by downloading an
installer from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win). 

Once you have downloaded the installer, double click on the downloaded file to 
execute it. This will start the installation process. Follow the instructions
of the installer (click "Next" to accept the license etc.). 

Make sure that everything associated with `Git Bash` is enabled, and
"Use Git from Git Bash only" is selected. This is the safest choice, as it will
install a `Git Bash` command window, which will have everything set up for 
running Git. We will use `Git Bash` in this workshop.

To start the program you need to find `Git Bash`. When you start `Git Bash` it will
open a command window in which you can type commands. 

Alternatively, if you are using Anaconda, you can install `git` from the command line:

```{.bash}
conda install -c anaconda git
```



### macOS

On macOS, you have several choices for how you install git.

1. You can use the git that is installed as part of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
(Apple's free development environment that is supplied as a separate download
for macOS). The best way to install this is via [Xcode on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Note that Xcode is a very large download, and installation will take a while.

2. Install git by going to the [official git website](https://git-scm.com/download) and 
choose macOS. There are instructions here to install via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
(via `brew install git`) or links to download a [binary installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/).



### Linux

Please install Git using your package manager, e.g. following the 
[instructions here](https://git-scm.com/download/linux).

The exact command you type will depend on your Linux distribution. Typically,
the command will look like `apt-get install git`, or `yum install git`, 
or `dnf install git`.

If you prefer to build and install from source, there are tarballs available
on [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/).



## Starting Git

Once you have installed git, you now need to start a command window. On Windows, you do this by starting `Git Bash`.
On Linux or macOS you need to open a command window (e.g. also called a "terminal", "bash window", "console").

To check that git is working, please type the following in the command window and press return;

```{.bash}
git --version
```

This should run the git command, and will print the version number of git to the screen. For example, 
on my Mac, I see this printed;

```
git version 2.24.3 (Apple Git-128)
```

Don't worry if you see something slightly different. The exact version number and format of this
output will depend on how you installed git. If you see something like this printed;

```
command not found: git
```

then that means that git is not installed, or something is wrong. Please go through the installation 
instructions again and double-check you have followed all steps.


## Choosing a text editor

We will also need to use a text editor. A text editor is a program that lets you create and edit
simple text files. There are many different text editors available. You are free to choose
the one you like the best. Commonly-installed text editors include;

* [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org) - this is a good text editor for beginners (and my favorite and
personal choice). It should be installed by default on Linux, macOS and Git Bash on Windows
(instructions for [installing it in Git Bash are here](https://coderwall.com/p/ee-law/use-nano-from-git-bash-on-windows-d) if it isn't available). On Linux,
if nano isn't available, then a similar program called `pico` likely is.

* [vim](https://www.vim.org) - this is a standard text editor that is installed nearly everywhere,
and is definitely available on all platforms (or, if not, then the less powerful alternative, called
`vi` is available). This is a more complex text editor to use, and is not recommended for beginners.

* [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) - this is a graphic text editor for Windows. This is
very easy for beginners to use, but is not available for macOS or Linux.

Note that we are using a text editor to make it easier to run the workshop. Git can be used
to version control all kinds of files produced using all kinds of programs. For example, you
could version control Word documents, PDFs, Excel spreadsheets and photos.
In this workshop, we will just work with text files.
